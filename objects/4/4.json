  "description": "This is a poster for a war film set in the Caucasus Mountains during World War I. Most Soviet war films from this time were designed to show how the hero's class consciousness as a proletarian was developed. The poster itself draws on elements of avant-garde art movements by fusing images of the film's characters with machines, utilizing photomontage, and how it is drawn in strong angular lines.",
