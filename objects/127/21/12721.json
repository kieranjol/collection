  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts the nude, child-god Harpokrates, sitting, with his left arm held at his side. He wears a close-fitting cap with uraeus and a large, braided sidelock. HIs right forefinger is held to his lips in a gesture meant to signify his youth. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at the time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly emodiment of Horus.",
