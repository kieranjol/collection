  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts the child-god, Harpokrates, striding forward, his left arm held at his side. He is nude and his head clean shaven except for the usual braided sidelock. On his head sits the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. His right forefinger is held to his lips in a gesture meant to signify his youth. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at the time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly embodiment of Horus.",
