  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts the child-god Harpokrates, striding forward, with his left arm held at his side. He wears a kilt, sidelock, and the double crown of upper and lower Egypt. His right forefinger is held to his lips in a gesture meant to signify his youth. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at that time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly embodiment of Horus.",
