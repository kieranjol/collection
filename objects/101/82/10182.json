  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts Osiris, the Egyptian god of death and the underworld. He stands mummiform, arms bent left over right, holding the crook and flail. On his head he wears an atef-crown with uraeus. The cult of Osiris dates back to the Old Kingdom, but became increasingly popular during the first millennium BC, when the majority of these figures were produced.",
