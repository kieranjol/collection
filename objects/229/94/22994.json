  "description": "The first two figures can be identified as women by the long braids that hand down their backs.  The second woman holds a circular object in her hand, likely a garland.  The third figure is a man.  The motion of his gait is visible by his separated legs.  Like the women, he holds his arms akimbo, perhaps in a gesture of greeting or veneration.  The man holds another circular object (or garland).  Facing them, seated in a high-backed chair with a bird underneath, is a figure who raises on arm and holds a spear in another.  Standing with her back to this seated figure is a woman, who also raises one arm and holds a garland in the other.  She faces another seated man.  This man sits in a chair whose legs form an X underneath the seat.  He holds a garland.  Behind this seated man is another standing figure, who faces the same direction and the two seated mean and holds a spear.  \n",
