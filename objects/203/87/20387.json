  "description": "A movie poster for a late 20s adventure film. Because it is set in an unexplored region of Central Asia (a place of mystery for most Russians), the poster has an aura of romance and orientalism.This poster is comprised of strong, angular lines and the contrasting colors of red, black, and yellow. An Indiana Jones like figure dominates the center.",
