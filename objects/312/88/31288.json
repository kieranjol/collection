  "description": "The silver egg server was made by Hamilton & Co in Calcutta around 1810. Robert Hamilton was sent to India by the East India Company to make silver for the English, who were then running the country, that was more suitable to their tastes than the locally produced silver. Mr. Hamilton initially made silver under his own name/marks until approximately 1808 when he established the company, which was known as the Garrard of India, under license from the EIC.\n \nThe egg server weighs approximately 37 oz. It is 7.5 cm high, not counting the finial, 13.7 cm interior diameter and 14.3 cm exterior diameter. Wynyard R.T. Wilkinson has written two very good books on Indian Colonial Silver and examples of a few pieces made by  Hamilton are  illustrated therein. As I said  previously, the only example of his work I have been able to find on this continent is a pot of much later date made by his company and owned by the William & Francine Clark Museum.",
