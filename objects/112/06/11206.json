  "description": "This hollow cast, bronze head was originally part of a votive statuette depicting the Egyptian god of the underworld, Osiris. He wears his usual atef-crown adorned with a uraeus. There are thin slots on each side of the crown for inserting separately cast plumes, which are now lost. The head has broken off at the neck, and there are still remnants of the casting matrix visible inside.",
