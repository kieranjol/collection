He wears a long kilt, necklace, and a tight-fitting skull cap. Imhotep was the architect of the Pharoah, Djoser (c. 2700 BC), and is credited with designing the famous step pyramid at Saqqara. He began to be worshiped as a god during the Late Period; his cult was focused at Memphis, where he was considered to be the son of Ptah.",
