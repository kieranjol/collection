  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts the child-god Harpokrates, sitting, with his arms held at his sides. He wears a close-fitting cap with uraeus and a large, braided sidelock. The head, torso and leges of this figure were cast separately. The cult of Harpokrates rapidly grew in popularity during the late first millennium BC. This is likely due to close association at the time between Harpokrates and the Egyptian pharaoh, who was commonly considered to be an earthly emodiment of Horus.",
