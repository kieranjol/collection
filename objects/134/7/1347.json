  "description": "This work has the illusion of an abstract painting from afar, yet is clearly a patchwork of collaged elements when viewed more closely. Berlant is known for creating delicate shapes with metal and here he has made a shadow box frame out of the material, complete with his characteristic steel brads. The paper collage at the center unites disparate images of a woman's head, palm tree, dog's mouth, and cat's eyes.",
