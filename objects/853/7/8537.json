  "description": "This hollow cast, votive statuette depicts the Egyptian god, Ptah, standing mummiform with a 'was' scepter in his hands. He wears a tight-fitting skullcap, necklace, bracelets and a pleated divine beard. The statue's hollow eye sockets were once inlaid, perhaps with glass, electrum or lapis lazuli. Ptah was the husband of Sehkmet and the father of Nefertem, who together made up the Memphan triad.",
