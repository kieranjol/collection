  "description": "This hollow cast, votive stautette depicts the Egyptian fertility goddess, Isis, standing erect, her arms tightly clutched at her sides. She wears a shear dress, divine wig, and a vulture headdress with uraeus; on top of her head are cow's horns, a solar-disk and two tall feather plumes. Representations of Isis with a plumed headdress were most common during the Ptolemaic Period. The surface of the statuette has been badly worn.",
