Solid and from bivalve mold. \n\nThough piece was purportedly found on island of Capri, other batch members' similarity to Hellenistic finds from Paestum shrine and fragment's own slight resemblance to terracotta head from sight justify broader attribution (Campania, southern Italy). Interest in states of consciousness is characteristic of developed Hellenistic art.",
